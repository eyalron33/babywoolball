# Baby Woolball
A name system for humans only.

Woolball is a sandbox name system with a clear separation between human (you, me, everybody) and artificial (AIs, bots, organizations) entities. Woolball uses ZK to generate qualitative statements on names (human? adult? honest?).

Baby Woolball is a simple version of Woolball where only humans can register names.
